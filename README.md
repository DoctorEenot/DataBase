# DataBase
DataBase.h - header file with core of DB.

DataBase.cpp - server for DB, uses new threads for every new user

Now it can do only very basic things, but soon I'll implement auto restoration DB from harddrive, and another convinient functionality.

That DB doesn't have any protection, because main purpose of that DB is speed.

Now it's only for Windows.
